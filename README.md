angular 1.x scaffolding for modularized enterprise projects

## Wish-List

- Material Design in the shell 
- Facebook auth (angular-facebook) 
- Firebase auth (angular-fire) 
- Begin to insert npm/grunt/gulp in order to build the solution to prod
- consider putting it to es7 and add a transpiler task


## Getting Started

Either fork or clone this repository and start renaming, adding stuff in order to implement your own solution. 

### Prerequisites

It is recommended that you have the latest nodejs stable build on your setup. A little set of commands that will install for linux


```
$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs

```

### Node Prerequisites
```
$ npm i -g bower

//needed for running the project, it can be http-server or any other http server 
$ npm i -g http-server 
``` 

### Installing

After the prereq above are installed, just navigate to the project folder and 

```
$ bower install 
```

And then to run it 
```
$ http-server 

```

## Running the tests

So far we haven't implemented any tests, so if you are the one to be the first to do so, please go ahead and change here 

### Break down into end to end tests

E2E Tests Execution example goes here : 
```
$ echo "Write tests and change me!!"
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Deployment instructions should be updated here, when either grunt or gulp or npm tasks are going to be incorporated in order to build the app into a deployable setup
